This JavaScript code snippet is a simple command-line todo list application that allows users to add, list, and delete todo items through prompts in the browser. It's structured into several functions, each handling a specific part of the application's functionality.

At the core, there's a [`todos`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") array that holds the list of todo items. The [`promptUser`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") function is a utility that displays a prompt dialog to the user with a custom message and returns the user's input. This function is used throughout the application to interact with the user.

The [`addTodo`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") function adds a new todo item to the list. It calls [`promptUser`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") to get the todo item from the user, adds this item to the [`todos`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") array, and logs a confirmation message.

The [`listTodos`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") function lists all current todo items. It prints a series of asterisks as a header and footer to make the list visually distinct, and then iterates over the [`todos`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") array, printing each todo item with its index. This index is crucial for the delete operation, as it allows users to specify which todo item they want to remove.

The [`deleteTodo`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A20%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") function removes a todo item based on its index. It prompts the user for the index of the todo to delete, parses this input to an integer, and checks if it's a valid index. If valid, it uses the [`splice`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2F.vscode%2Fextensions%2Fms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next-5.6.20240709%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es5.d.ts%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2F.vscode%2Fextensions%2Fms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next-5.6.20240709%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es5.d.ts%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2F.vscode%2Fextensions%2Fms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next-5.6.20240709%2Fnode_modules%2Ftypescript%2Flib%2Flib.es5.d.ts%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A1398%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D "../../../../.vscode/extensions/ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next-5.6.20240709/node_modules/typescript/lib/lib.es5.d.ts") method to remove the item from the [`todos`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") array and logs the deleted item. If the index is invalid, it logs an error message.

The [`handleInvalidRequest`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A33%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") function is a simple utility that logs a message prompting the user to enter a valid request. This is used in cases where the user's input doesn't match any of the expected commands.

The [`handleRequest`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A37%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") function takes the user's request, processes it, and calls the appropriate function based on the command ('new', 'list', 'delete', or 'quit'). It uses a `switch` statement to handle the different cases. If the user decides to quit (by entering 'quit' or 'q'), the function returns `true`, signaling the application to stop running.

Finally, the [`main`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A58%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "app.js") function contains the application's main loop. It repeatedly prompts the user for a command until the [`quit`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2Fdt-workspace%2Fcolt%2FtoDos%2Fapp.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A59%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%5D "app.js") flag is set to `true`, indicating that the user has chosen to exit the application. This loop ensures the application keeps running, allowing for multiple operations until the user decides to quit.

The entire application is encapsulated in these functions, demonstrating basic control flow, array manipulation, and user interaction in JavaScript.
